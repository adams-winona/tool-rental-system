### Overview of Interaction

As part of the Tool Rental programming assignment, I utilized AI as a professional coding assistant to accelerate development, ensure specification alignment, and maintain clean code structure. The AI was used iteratively for planning, development, testing, and documentation.

### Key Prompt Areas

**1. Requirement Analysis and Breakdown**  
Prompted AI to summarize and clarify the PDF specification to ensure full understanding of tool behaviors, pricing rules, holiday logic, and expected outputs.

**2. Project Setup**  
Requested assistance in setting up a Maven-based Java project in IntelliJ IDEA with proper folder structures and dependencies (JUnit 5, Surefire).

**3. Core Implementation**  
Used AI to generate the structure and logic for:
- `Tool`, `ToolType`, `RentalAgreement`, and `CheckoutService`
- Custom exception handling with `RentalValidationException`
- Holiday handling logic in `HolidayUtil`
- Output formatting as per assignment specs

**4. Test Coverage**  
Generated and verified all six required test cases using JUnit 5, including edge cases and exception handling.

**5. Troubleshooting Errors**  
Resolved issues related to:
- Maven dependencies not syncing
- IntelliJ test runner errors due to incorrect package naming
- Runtime validation and rounding logic

**6. Documentation Support**  
AI helped generate this `AI_INTERACTION_LOG.md` and a complete `README.md` aligned with professional standards.

### Reflection on AI Collaboration

The AI significantly improved productivity and confidence during the assignment by:
- Clarifying ambiguous specifications
- Speeding up boilerplate code generation
- Guiding me through test-driven development

I retained full responsibility for reviewing, testing, and refining all code and ensuring that it met the assignment’s expectations.

### Final Note

Every line of the final implementation was understood and manually verified. The AI served strictly as an accelerator and code reviewer in this process.
